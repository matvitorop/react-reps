# Lab â„–1

This lab contains two variants of same functionality. One version created as [solid chat component](./src/Components/Chat). Second is attempt to split every element on their own component.

At first glance, I thought it will be more correctly if I will make [split components](./src/Components/Attempts), but from another perspective no sense to make micro components that will not be used alone in the future.

Therefore, I will be glad to see a feedback from you about this situation.
